# GBC-Spelunky
 An attempt to demake Spelunky 2 for GBC.
 This was a wildly ambitious project, and I only just managed to get a playable version ready.
 I would say the code is pretty well documented.
 Do whatever you want with the code, just credit me (sukus) if you want to use any of it.
 
 Developed using Emulicious, hUGETracker and RGBDS.

# Controls
